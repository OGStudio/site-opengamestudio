<p>This article summarizes the work we did to produce OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide.</p>
<p>June marked the finish of <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide">OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide</a> with the publishing of the last (initially planned) tutorial. The tutorial describes <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/tree/master/1.10.SampleWeb">how to build and run sample OpenSceneGraph application in Web</a> using Emscripten.
In case you missed it, here's a <a href="https://ogstudio.github.io/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/">link to the final application</a>. Open it in your web browser.</p>
<p>We started to compose the guide in February when we successfully managed to render a simple model on mobile and web. We spent 120 hours in five months to produce ten tutorials of the guide.</p>
<p>We have been doing OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep OpenSceneGraph cross-platform knowledge in easily accessible and reproducible form</li>
<li>Share the knowledge with OpenSceneGraph community to make it stronger</li>
</ol>
<p>We believe we succeeded in both. Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The guide repository has more <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/stargazers">stars</a> (aka "likes") than any other repository of ours</li>
<li>OpenSceneGraph project leader Robert Osfield said <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-users@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg74815.html">"Great work"</a>, which means a lot</li>
<li>The guide already has <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/issues">two issues</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Reaching our goal of researching OpenSceneGraph cross-platform development and providing the knowledge back to the community just made us happier.</p>
<p>However, our journey does not stop here. Using the knowledge of the guide, we now continue to work on bringing our tools to support mobile and web, just as we <a href="the-year-of-challenges.html">promised in January</a>.</p>
<p>That's it for summarizing the work we did to produce OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide.</p>

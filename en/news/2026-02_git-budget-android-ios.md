# January

In January I've resurrected GitBudget project for two reasons:

1. Combine job goals and hobby ones because they overlap through Kotlin Multiplatform
2. Evaluate Kotlin Multiplatform in decreasing code duplication among platforms (the positive results are described in [Хабр article][habr]).

[In the distant 2020][gb-old] when I approached GitBudget the first time my
main idea was to track history of spendings, not analysis. This time my
priority was to calculate the available balance left to be spent a day, i.e.,
analysis.

# February

In February I plan to port GitBudget to Desktop with the help of Qt.

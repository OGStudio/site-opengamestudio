<h1 id="supportedplatforms">Supported platforms</h1>
<p>To verify code portability, I selected the following platforms and languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>C++: Linux, macOS, OpenWrt, Windows</li>
<li>JavaScript: Chrome, Firefox, Safari</li>
<li>Kotlin: Android</li>
<li>Python: Linux, macOS, Windows</li>
<li>Swift: iOS, macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a simple "Hello World" example for each language to understand the basic requirements of each platform.</p>
<p>By the way, OpenWrt turned out the most complex platform to create "Hello World" for, because my TP-Link TL-MR3020 r1 router is considered obsolete since 2018. I had to use the old 17.01.7 firmware, which took about three weeks.</p>
<h1 id="anchorlanguageandlimitedlanguagemodel">Anchor language and limited language model</h1>
<p>For the whole month I was asking myself the same question: "Which language should I choose as a starting point to convert to other languages from?" Initial considerations were pointing me to C++ due to strong types. However, as soon as I found out Python has Type hints, I chose Python.</p>
<p>Python is good because:</p>
<ul>
<li>one can specify a type with Type hints</li>
<li>Python has portability across Linux, macOS, Windows out of the box</li>
<li>pip simplifies distribution of the language conversion instrument</li>
<li>Python does not require a separate compilation step, which speeds up development</li>
</ul>
<p>However, not every Python code will suite the language conversion instrument under development. Only the code that satisfies the constraints of the <code>Limited language model</code>.</p>
<p>Limited language model is a subset of Python with various restrictions in both syntax and a set of available functions. Here is a glimpse of those restrictions, the image below depicts Python to C++ conversion result:</p>

<p>I'm going to write game logic for "Memory" in Python and convert it to C++ by the instrument under development.</p>

# Sound

In September I implemented sound support. However, this was the last
work for "Tail and Shadow" project, because the project's story writer -
Eugene - left.

# Searching for a new direction

In September I also noticed the loss of interest in the project by the
audience. I linked this to the fact that the project's functional and
graphical results did not match that of the audience.

That's why I decided to try a couple of technical ideas to revive the
project:

## 1. Voxels

I checked if I can create content in [Goxel][goxel] voxel editor
instead of paper and pen. This is what I got:

    <source src="../../images/2024_goxel.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

## 2. RPG Maker

I've also completed several [RPG Maker][rpg-maker] tutorials to see if I can
create a game using existing instrument. This is what I got:

<video controls width="700">
    <source src="../../images/2024_rpg-maker.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

This looks a lot like a game, however I have no interest in doing that alone.
I'm fond of technically challenging issues like creating a game engine,
not using existing instruments to create a game.

# October

That's why I decided to return to PSKOV static site generator to make
it more convenient, accessible, and durable.

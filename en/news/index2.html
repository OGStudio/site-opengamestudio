<p>When July started my initial plan was to make the instrument support Python to
JavaScript code translation. However, this did not happen because tasks with
higher priority emerged.</p>
<p>Which task is more important than develpment of the instrument?
Development of a game, of course! Now, let's go back to the beginning of
July 2024…</p>

<p>In June I implemented GUI for "Memory" game in Python with the help of
<a href="https://arcade.academy">Python Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>While searching for the most convenient tool to create resources (assets), I found
notebooks lined with graph paper to work the best:</p>

<h1 id="memorytextui">"Memory" text UI</h1>
<p>In May I implemented text UI for "Memory" game in Python. And converted it to C++
by the instrument under development.</p>
<p>Game logic cycle implementation lead to the creation of a controller that manages
context. Creating the controller in Python was straightforward. C++ version took
some time, because the controller needs <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/any">std::any</a>, which is part of C++17.
The instrument under development is limited to C++11 in order to support OpenWrt.</p>

<h1 id="memorygamelogic">"Memory" game logic</h1>
<p>In April I implemented "Memory" game logic in Python as limited language model and successfully converted the code to C++ by the instrument under development.</p>
<p>Limited language model assumes the following architecture of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>state context</li>
<li>pure functions without side effects working only with the context</li>
</ol>
<p>Game logic state context in Python currently looks like this (<a href="https://git.opengamestudio.org/kornerr/research-portable-memory/src/commit/6fcd542daa6242c8c23dddb88d04cda74a730328/v3/memory_Context.h">C++</a>):</p>

<p>To verify code portability, I selected the following platforms and languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>C++: Linux, macOS, OpenWrt, Windows</li>
<li>JavaScript: Chrome, Firefox, Safari</li>
<li>Kotlin: Android</li>
<li>Python: Linux, macOS, Windows</li>
<li>Swift: iOS, macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a simple "Hello World" example for each language to understand the basic requirements of each platform.</p>
<p>By the way, OpenWrt turned out the most complex platform to create "Hello World" for, because my TP-Link TL-MR3020 r1 router is considered obsolete since 2018. I had to use the old 17.01.7 firmware, which took about three weeks.. . .</p>

<h1 id="thefirstbuspatternimplementationforios">The first Bus pattern implementation for iOS</h1>
<p>I spent January and February making Bus pattern implementation in Swift for iOS.
The end result looks nice to me.</p>
<p>I have also done load testing. Turns out, the Bus is 92 times more expensive
than a function call. Nonetheless, this doesn't mean the Bus is bad. On the
contrary, the numbers highlight the Bus should be used in architectural
glue code where it can save up to 30% of code</p>
<p>This example demonstrates several states rendered through a single instance:. . .</p>

<h1 id="onthewaytoportablecode">On the way to portable code</h1>
<p>To gain code portability, we have to divide whole code into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>repeatable: logic</li>
<li>unique: environment</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify portable code construction, we want to be able to place any code -
both repeatable and unique - without hierarchy requirements of operating
systems. Bus design pattern seems to be the best option. The Bus makes all
code chunks equal because they interact through the Bus only.</p>

<p>In 2011 we had a dream that we as a team would grow, which could decrease

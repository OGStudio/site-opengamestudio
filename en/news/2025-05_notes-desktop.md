# Notes

In April I created a web application to take notes.

Initially, the features I wanted to implement were:

1. keep data in Git
1. web application uses DoX architecture
1. data is synchronized among several clients: PC, mobile, etc.

I have managed to fulfill the first two items only, didn't have time for the
third one. Thus, the application is pretty much useless at the moment.
I'm going to finish the third item later.

As for DoX architecture, it proved itself inconvenient so I won't describe it.
The only thing I can say about the architecture of the next Notes version: it
will use [Context/Controller/Should][ccs].

# May

In May I plan to create a draft of PSKOV 2 editor.

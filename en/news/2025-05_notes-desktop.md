# Notes

In April I created a web application to take notes.

Initially, here are the features I wanted to implement:

1. keep data in Git
1. web application uses DoX architecture
1. data is synchronized among several clients: PC, mobile, etc.

I have managed to fulfill the first two items only, didn't have time for the
third one. The app is pretty much useless without the third item so
I'm going to continue developing the notes app later to fulfill the
third item.

As for DoX architecture, it proved itself bad so I won't tell anything
more about it. I would only mention that the next notes app version
will use [Context/Controller/Should][ccs] that I described earlier.

# May

I will continue to develop PSKOV 2 so that it makes its way into browsers.

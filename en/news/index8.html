<p>We completed Editor 0.4.0 in January. As it was planned, it only contains basic abilities to open and save a project. The major goal was to make MJIN, Python and Qt work together (we were unable to use PyQt or PySide due to technical difficulties).</p>

<p>The development of Editor 0.3.0 showed us, that usage of custom GUI was not a perfect idea. A few months ago, custom GUI seemed as a simpler way to do things, but it turned out to lack many little features, that are crucial if you're planning to make a convenient tool.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided to do what we wanted to do in the first place - to use Qt library as the GUI library for our editor.</p>
<p>So, we'll rewrite the Editor with Qt interface and a little bit refreshed project concept in mind. We plan to release the editor with new GUI and a set of basic features like loading and saving projects in May.. . .</p>

<p>About a year ago, we started the user survey, in order to find out what do you think of the Open Source in general and about our project in particular. Today we're closing this survey. It took time, but we've got plenty of answers. Thank you for that.</p>
<p>We'll share our thought about the results of the survey in one of the future articles.</p>
<p>After the survey, every one of you has got the code. With this code, you'll be able to access the alpha test of the OGS Mahjong 2, as soon as we'll be ready to start it (i can't promise anything, but we're planning to do it in 2015). Also, you'll be able to choose between the deluxe version of OGS Mahjong 2 and the deluxe version of Shuan, as soon as we'll be ready to release these games.. . .</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>So, this year comes to the end. There were very little publications from us during this year. We haven't stopped working, but right now our work is in the phase, when we have nothing to show. And the spare time of the team members is rarely more then 30-40 hours a month.</p>
<p>But our work continues. And you can find out some details in the new <a href="exaggerated-expectations.html">article from our programmer Michael Kapelko</a>.</p>

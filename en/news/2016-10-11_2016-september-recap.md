This article explains September 2016 live session stages: draft, rehearsal, live session itself, and publishing.

Even though live session takes only a few hours, we devote a whole month to prepare for it. Let's have a look at live session stages in detail.

1. **Draft.** Game creation for the first time.

    Purposes:

    * test our technologies and fix major bugs;
    * discover usability issues to fix in the next development iteration;
    * list exact steps to reproduce the game later;
    * create draft version of the game assets (models, textures, sounds, scripts).

    Upon stage completion, we announce live session date and show you the game preview.

1. **Rehearsal.** Game recreation.

    Purposes:

    * make sure we have no major bugs left;
    * record the whole process of the game creation;
    * create final game assets.

    This is 99% the game we publish later.

1. **Live session.** Reassembling the game live in front of you.

    Purposes:

    * show how easy it is to create a game;
    * walk you through nuances of game creation;
    * get feedback from you;
    * answer your questions.

    We take game assets from the rehearsal and use them to quickly reassemble the game in just a few hours.

1. **Publishing.** The release of our technologies' last version, live session materials, and stand alone game.

That's it for explaining September 2016 live session stages: draft, rehearsal, live session itself, and publishing.

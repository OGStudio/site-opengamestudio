# On the way to portable code

To gain code portability, we have to divide whole code into two parts:

* repeatable: logic
* unique: environment

To simplify portable code construction, we want to be able to place any code -
both repeatable and unique - without hierarchy requirements of operating
systems. Bus design pattern seems to be the best option. The Bus makes all
code chunks equal because they interact through the Bus only.

# Bus-01

Currently we have:

Module structure:

![Module's YML][yml]

<yml>

Part of the visual representation:

![Visual representation][v]

Main functionality:

1. Format input to leave only digits
1. Activate the button when at least 3 digits are present
1. Simulate loading when pressing the button

This was an example of a single instance of an entity.

Next we're going to deal with multiple instances of an entity.

In August I implemented scene switching, which allowed me to do the following:

* pressing "Start the game" button in the splash screen takes the player to a level with three floors
* selecting a door takes the player to another floor
* selecting a TV set focuses the player on the TV set with a remote control
* switching TV channels results in different images being shown

Thus, scenes are good both for focusing on items and moving the player around.

# September

I plan to implement replay of short sounds in September.

I stumbled upon an interesting ["Time after tax"][tax] post. The author briefly
tells how after spending time on mandatory day to day
activities (sleep, work, commute, wash, etc.) he is only left with
3 hours of free time. The author calls this "Time after tax".

That concept explains where I take time for "Tail and Shadow" project.
For example, I managed to spend 27 hours for the project in August, that's
about 1 hour a day. Of course, one would spend 27 hours on a full-time job 
in 3-4 days, but a job won't let you make your dream come true.

Do you use "time after tax"?

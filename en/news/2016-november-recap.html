<p>This article describes the start of MJIN library separation into modules.</p>
<p>Once we built OpenSceneGraph for Android, it became obvious that some MJIN functionality is not suitable for Android. For example, UIQt provides a basis for OGS Editor UI. Since OGS Editor is a desktop application, we don't need UIQt for Android.</p>
<p>We decided to have a look at two approaches to separate MJIN into modules: build-time separation and run-time one. 
<strong>Build-time</strong> separation means MJIN becomes highly configurable and each platform gets specifically tailored MJIN build.
<strong>Run-time</strong> separation means MJIN is divided into smaller libraries that are connected at run-time, which makes it easy to change functionality without rebuilding.</p>
<p><strong>Run-time separation research.</strong></p>
<p>Since run-time separation has more benefits, we started researching it first. The easiest way to achieve it was to use C API, because C ABI rules are much simpler than C++ one's.</p>
<p>We created a sample project consisting of the application, library, and plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The application</strong> has been linked to the library and used it to load the plugin.</li>
<li><strong>The library</strong> provided functions to register plugins and call their functions.</li>
<li><strong>The plugin</strong> provided functions for the library and called library functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The research was successful: the sample project worked correctly under Linux and Windows. However, since MJIN is currently a single large entity, we postponed C API application until we finish build-time separation.</p>
<p><strong>Build-time separation start.</strong></p>
<p>We extracted the following modules from MJIN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: provides Java Native Interface (JNI) to MJIN</li>
<li>Sound: provides access to OpenAL</li>
<li>UIQt: provides access to Qt UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound and UIQt modules are currently statically linked into MJIN library, while Android module is already a separate library due to JNI requirements.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we're going to significantly restructure MJIN so that it suits as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>That's it for describing the start of MJIN library separation into modules.</p>

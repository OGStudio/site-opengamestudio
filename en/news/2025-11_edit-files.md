# October

### 1. NPM

PSKOV is now available via npm. The easiest way to launch PSKOV is with the help of `npx`:

```npx pskov --projectDir=/path/to/project```

where `/path/to/project` should be replaced with an actual path to a project

### 2. `Files`, `Edit`, `Render` tabs

PSKOV now has tabs which allow you to select a file, edit it or preview the result of Markdown conversion (previewing is not implemented yet)

### 3. Editing and saving of a selected file

PSKOV can now edit files (using Ace) and save them by clicking the diskette button

# November

I plan to implement previewing of the result of Markdown conversion

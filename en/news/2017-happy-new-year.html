<p>Okay. It's been a hard year for everyone in the team. And it's almost over. Praise it ends! Praise the new one!</p>
<p>It may seem, that our progress stalled. Three years ago we announced the beginning of a new project (two to be precise), and now we still working on the engine and editor, haven't even started creating the actual game.</p>
<p>If you were monitoring our news during the year, you know that we held several live sessions, showing in the real time how to use our tools to create some simple games. Each session was a step in a long road to our goal. While preparing for these live sessions, we added necessary building blocks, that will be needed to create almost any game.</p>
<p>Future live sessions and technical previews will add even more, so at some point in future (i hope not very distant), we will have everything we need to sit down and build our planned game from these blocks.</p>
<p>So, the project isn't dead; the idea was not thrown away. But there is a lot of work to be done before we can start making the game, and there are only two of us, using our spare time.
So. You want our game to become a reality? Join us. Together we will rule the galaxy. Or just wait and see. We didn't stop several years ago. We won't stop now.
After all, there is only one way to create a fine tool (and it's our initial goal if you remember) - we need to use it ourselves.
We will. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Happy 2017. Let it be simple.</p>

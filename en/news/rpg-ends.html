<h1 id="thedreamofanopensourcerpgisover">The dream of an open source RPG is over</h1>
<p>In 2005 the Opensource Game Studio project started
under the name of the <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/general-10/the-creation-of-the-best-rpg-355858/">Opensource RPG</a>, because we wanted
to create "the first competitive open free game".
In 2011 right after releasing OGS Mahjong 0.7 we have already
had the numbers that it would take us <a href="https://gamedev.ru/community/ogs/articles/?id=6383">540 years to create RPG</a>.</p>
<p>In 2011 we had a dream that we as a team would grow, which could decrease
540 years to someting reasonable. However today in the end of 2023 it's clear
<strong>we are unable to create RPG</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="validationofthesoftwaredurabilityhypothesis">Validation of the software durability hypothesis</h1>
<p>In 2013 we have released OGS Mahjong 1.1, the last completed product as
part of the Opensource Game Studio project. Surprisingly OGS Mahjong still
shows the signs of life, albeit its <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/osrpgcreation/files/Mahjong/1.1.0/ogs-mahjong-1.1.0-windows32.exe/stats/timeline?dates=2013-05-05+to+2023-12-01">download chart</a> resembles
death agony:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2023_rpg-ends_mjdl.jpg" alt="OGS Mahjong 1.1 downloads in 10 years" /></p>
<p>Recently we have checked if OGS Mahjong 1.1 runs under Linux. Unfortunately,
the game did run right out of the box. We had to create a few symlinks, and
that worked. Thus, a bit of environment setup was required. That's a good
result for a 10 year old software.</p>
<p>In 2019 we created <a href="https://opengamestudio.org/pskov/en/pskov_1.0.0+en.html">PSKOV</a>, our own static site generator to have
site articles in a convenient Markdown format. Also, we did PSKOV in web to
check web software durability. Today, 4 years from the initial release,
web software durability hypothesis proves itself right. We're sure PSKOV of 2019
will be functioning in 2029 without a single change. However, we have to wait
for 6 more years for that to come true.</p>
<p>OGS Mahjong and PSKOV prove that durability of 4-10 years is not a fantasy.
The durability is essential to hobby projects, because hobbyists can't catch
up to the always changing Operating Systems' requirements. <strong>We consider the
Opensource Game Studio software has passed the durability check</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="theportablecodehypothesis">The portable code hypothesis</h1>
<p>Our next step is to have portable code. That means the code is ~80%
technically identical on each platform: Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, Windows.</p>
<p>The portability is essential to hobby projects, because hobbyists don't have
the ability to regularly validate their code on each platform. <strong>We are going
to take portability to the new level for both OGS Mahjong and PSKOV</strong>.</p>
<p>Going to be interesting.</p>

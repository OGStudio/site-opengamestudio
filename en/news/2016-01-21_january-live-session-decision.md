We are ready to present Editor 0.8 with Player. The live session will be held at <a title="LiveCoding" href="https://www.livecoding.tv/kornerr">LiveCoding</a> SOON. We will show you how to create a simple game with sounds from scratch. And this time it will not need an Editor to run.

The exact date and time is to be announced in the coming days. Stay tuned!

As you know, the previously published roadmap assumed, that we would hold a live session in April and it would feature a ping-pong game created with Editor 0.9.

We have to admit, our abilities to plan are not yet good enough. That's why the next live session will take place by the end of May. The exact date will be announced later.

Here's a short preview of the coming game:

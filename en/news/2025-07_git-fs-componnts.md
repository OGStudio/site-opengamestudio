# Components' draft

In June I've created drafts of the following PSKOV 2 components:

* FS: virtual file system based on LightningFS
* Git: Git support based on Isomorphic-Git

Currently one can do the following in PSKOV 2:

* clone Git repository
* inspect the list of Git repository files
* clean up file system and start anew

# July

In July I plan to add the following:

* display files for currently selected directory only instead of showing them all
* view and edit Repository file contents

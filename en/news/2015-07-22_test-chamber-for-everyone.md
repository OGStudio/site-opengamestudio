As you know, the main goal of Editor 0.7.0 is the ability to create the <a title="Test chamber" href="https://youtu.be/9_6seUWcPbU" target="_blank">test chamber</a> with it. It needs Actions' system and a few stability fixes for that. We are going to publish a detailed article describing how to create the test chamber, too, so that anyone could create their own test chamber!

We estimate to complete it in October.

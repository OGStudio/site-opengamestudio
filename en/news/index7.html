<p>We completed Editor 0.4.0 in January. As it was planned, it only contains basic abilities to open and save a project. The major goal was to make MJIN, Python and Qt work together (we were unable to use PyQt or PySide due to technical difficulties).. . .</p>

<p>The development of Editor 0.3.0 showed us, that usage of custom GUI was not a perfect idea. A few months ago, custom GUI seemed as a simpler way to do things, but it turned out to lack many little features, that are crucial if you're planning to make a convenient tool.. . .</p>

<p>About a year ago, we started the user survey, in order to find out what do you think of the Open Source in general and about our project in particular. Today we're closing this survey. It took time, but we've got plenty of answers. Thank you for that.. . .</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>So, this year comes to the end. There were very little publications from us during this year. We haven't stopped working, but right now our work is in the phase, when we have nothing to show. And the spare time of the team members is rarely more then 30-40 hours a month.. . .</p>

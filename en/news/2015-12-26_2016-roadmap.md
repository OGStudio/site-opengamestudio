As you know, according to the [previously published roadmap][roadmap-2015-2016], we now have sound system in place. However, we decided to go further and implement the first version of Player. We wanted to get it done by December, but, unfortunately, more work resulted in the change of dates.

Here's the revised roadmap for the first half of 2016:

1. Editor + Player 0.8.0 (January 2016): Sound system, Whac-a-mole game with sounds
1. Editor + Player 0.9.0 (April 2016): Networking system, simple ping pong game for 2 players over the net
1. Editor + Player 0.10.0 (July 2016): Polishing, "Shuan" prototype

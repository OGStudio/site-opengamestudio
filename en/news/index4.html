<p>This article describes our first durable application for desktop PCs: PSKOV static site generator.</p>
<p><strong>Durability</strong></p>
<p>A durable application is an application that functions without a single change on operating systems released in years 2010-2030. In other words, a durable application has backward compatibility of 10 years and has the stability to run for 10 years. Actually, <a href="http://opengamestudio.org/pskov">PSKOV</a> runs even under Windows 2000, so PSKOV has backward compatibility of 19 years.. . .</p>

<p>In this article, we describe the beginning of our efforts to protect ourselves from third-party solutions.</p>
<p>Since day one of Opensource Game Studio project, we rely heavily on third-party solutions to help us achieve the goal of creating the best game development tools. To this date, we used forums, task trackers, mailing lists, social networks, code version control systems, hosting providers, compiler suites, libraries, and so on. Each third-party solution we used had its own lifespan.. . .</p>

<p>In this article, Michael shares his experience of teaching kids to program.</p>
<p>Here's what he covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>organization of the learning process</li>
<li>learning plan</li>
<li>memory game</li>
<li>development tools</li>
<li>lessons</li>
<li>results and plans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organization of the learning process</strong></p>
<p>The learning process is conducted as part of corporate social responsibility: a company provides a room with equipment and connects employees that want to try themselves in the role of teachers with employees that want their kids educated. All this is done voluntarily.. . .</p>

<p>It was a year of reimagining and rethinking. As some of you may remember, we started this project to make a game development tool. During the years, the idea evolved from one form to another, sometimes the changes were significant, other times we threw away all the code and started anew.</p>
<p>As a result of all these changes, we came to the end of the year 2018 without a tool, but with a clear understanding of what tool are we making.</p>
<p>There are plenty of fine game development tools out there. Some of them are even open source. We spent plenty of time trying them, and some are quite good.. . .</p>

<p>In this article, we discuss how ideal video game and video game development tool look like, in our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>As you know, the <a href="../../en/page/about.html">goals of Opensource Game Studio</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>creation of free video game development tools</li>
<li>making video games with those tools</li>
<li>preparing video game development tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>This time we asked ourselves two simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an ideal video game?</li>
<li>What is an ideal video game development tool?. . .</li>
</ul>

<p>We are glad to announce the release of the second demonstration of OGS Mahjong 2.  The purposes of this release were to refine our development techniques and build a solid cross-platform foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong></p>
<p>Run the latest version of OGS Mahjong 2 in your web browser: <a href="http://ogstudio.github.io/ogs-mahjong">http://ogstudio.github.io/ogs-mahjong</a></p>
<p>You are encouraged to run the game with <code>seed</code> parameter like this: <a href="http://ogstudio.github.io/ogs-mahjong?seed=0">http://ogstudio.github.io/ogs-mahjong?seed=0</a>. . .</p>

<p>This article describes two new OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples and the change in handling dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of HTTP client and node selection</strong></p>
<p>Once we finished working on <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples/tree/master/04.RemoteDebugging">the remote debugging example</a> and <a href="example-driven-development.html">reported its completion</a>, we were surprised by the fact that secure HTTP connection between a debugged application and debug broker was only working in the web version of the example. Desktop and mobile versions only worked with insecure HTTP.. . .</p>

<p>This article explains how the third OpenSceneGraph cross-platform example opened our eyes to example-driven development.</p>
<p><strong>2018-08 EDIT</strong>: the third example has been renamed to the fourth one due to the reasons described in the <a href="examples-and-dependencies.html">next article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The third OpenSceneGraph cross-platform example</strong></p>
<p>The third OpenSceneGraph cross-platform example explains how to implement <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples/tree/master/04.RemoteDebugging">remote debugging across platforms</a>. This example is less about OpenSceneGraph and more about different platforms.. . .</p>

<p>This article summarizes the work we did to produce the first two cross-platform OpenSceneGraph examples.</p>
<p>By the time <a href="mahjong-techdemo1-gameplay.html">the first technology demonstration of OGS Mahjong 2</a> has been released, we've already had <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/issues/4">issue request</a> (to explain how to load images with OpenSceneGraph on Android) hanging for some time. We considered creating a new tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide">OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide</a> at first. However, we realized that it's time-consuming and excessive for such a tiny topic (compared to what an average game has) as image loading. We decided to continue sharing our knowledge in the form of concrete examples. That's how <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples">OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples</a> were born.. . .</p>

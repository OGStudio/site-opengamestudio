<p>In this article, we discuss how ideal video game and video game development tool look like, in our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>As you know, the <a href="../../en/page/about.html">goals of Opensource Game Studio</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>creation of free video game development tools</li>
<li>making video games with those tools</li>
<li>preparing video game development tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>This time we asked ourselves two simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an ideal video game?</li>
<li>What is an ideal video game development tool?. . .</li>
</ul>

<p>This article describes two new OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples and the change in handling dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of HTTP client and node selection</strong></p>
<p>Once we finished working on <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples/tree/master/04.RemoteDebugging">the remote debugging example</a> and <a href="example-driven-development.html">reported its completion</a>, we were surprised by the fact that secure HTTP connection between a debugged application and debug broker was only working in the web version of the example. Desktop and mobile versions only worked with insecure HTTP.. . .</p>

<p><strong>2018-08 EDIT</strong>: the third example has been renamed to the fourth one due to the reasons described in the <a href="examples-and-dependencies.html">next article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The third OpenSceneGraph cross-platform example</strong></p>
<p>The third OpenSceneGraph cross-platform example explains how to implement <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples/tree/master/04.RemoteDebugging">remote debugging across platforms</a>. This example is less about OpenSceneGraph and more about different platforms.. . .</p>

<p>This article summarizes the work we did to produce the first two cross-platform OpenSceneGraph examples.</p>
<p>By the time <a href="mahjong-techdemo1-gameplay.html">the first technology demonstration of OGS Mahjong 2</a> has been released, we've already had <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide/issues/4">issue request</a> (to explain how to load images with OpenSceneGraph on Android) hanging for some time. We considered creating a new tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide">OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide</a> at first. However, we realized that it's time-consuming and excessive for such a tiny topic (compared to what an average game has) as image loading. We decided to continue sharing our knowledge in the form of concrete examples. That's how <a href="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-examples">OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples</a> were born.. . .</p>

<p>This article describes the start of Mahjong game recreation.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>We started Mahjong recreation endeavour by composing a brief plan to get gameplay with minimal graphics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load single layout</li>
<li>Place tiles in layout positions</li>
<li>Distinguish tiles</li>
<li>Implement selection</li>
<li>Implement matching</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like any other plan, this one looked fine at first sight. However, once you get down to work, new details start to come out. This plan was no exception. Below are a few problems that came out during development.. . .</p>

<p>So, the year 2017 is approaching its finale, the year's results have already been summed up. We're going to take a break from igniting the fireworks or preparation of the champagne so that we can designate our goal for the following year.</p>
<p>As it may be clear from other articles on the site, half of our plans in 2017 were destined to be completed at least approximately as we assumed. The other half was changed significantly.</p>
<p>During the year, people joined the team and left it. As a result, we meet the end of the year with exactly the same team as 365 days ago. It made us think.  A lot. But We'll save the story for another time.. . .</p>

<p>It's time to step back to see our accomplishments in 2017 and how they connect to the overall goal of Opensource Game Studio project.</p>
<p><strong>Brief history</strong></p>
<p>Opensource Game Studio project is 12 years old now.</p>
<p><strong>2005.</strong> We started the project with a <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/general-10/the-creation-of-the-best-rpg-355858/">fanatic call</a> to create the best game ever. Probably right after finishing Half-Life 2 or Morrowind. 99.99% of those who wanted to participate weathered during a couple of years leaving only the two of us: Michael (coding) and Ivan (the rest). The project was in a constant turmoil because we had no clear purpose and discipline. Thus, we only got a handful of demonstrations during that period.. . .</p>

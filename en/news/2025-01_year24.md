# Results

Let's see the results of the year 2024 quarter by quarter:

* **The first quarter** (January - March):
    * (Swift) Implemented data bus for iOS to create common space of communication for fragmented code
    * Introduced "Limited language model" term to describe potable code rules used by OGS team
    * Python was selected as the anchor programming language from which to generate functional copies in other languages
* **The second quarter** (April - June):
    * (Python) Created the first version of Python -> C++ translator
    * Created text UI for "Memory" game
    * Created graphics UI for "Memory" game with assests based on sketches drawn on the graph paper
* **The third quarter** (July - September):
    * (Python) Created 2D adventure game prototype using Python Arcade
    * Renamed "Limited language model" term to "Cross-language dialect" to better convey the nature of achieving portable code
    * Participated in a 3-day long gamejam to see how cross-language dialect works in real case scenarios
* **The fourth quarter** (October - December):
    * (Kotlin) Created the first version of [Local Host Access][lha], a small web server to provide local file system access to web pages
    * (Kotlin) Created the first version of translator to convert YML to Kotlin
    * Kotlin replaced Python as the anchor programming language due to Kotlin's strong typing and Kotlin's community propensity towards portable code

For me, portable code is no longer an idea, it is reality.
However, "Cross-language dialect" approach needs more love
to blossom for others to see its beauty. That's where I'm going to
pour my free time during 2025.

# January

I'll start rewriting PSKOV in Kotlin for JVM.

# The clash with git push limits

In August I've added `git commit` and `git push` commands to PSKOV.
However, it became clear that Vercel (we use the service to host CORS
proxy) does not allow `git push` requests for a moderately sized
repository (50M) of this very site. Vercel returns `413 Content
too large` error.

Thus, to support `git push` for moderately sized repositories, I would
need to run my own server with CORS proxy. I have neither money, nor
time to do that at the moment, unfortunately.

That's why, having stumpled upon the wall of reality once again, I have to
retreat: PSKOV will now be a Node.js application that generate sites
locally. A user can manager Git himself.

# September

In September I will create the first version of PSKOV for Node.js
using Kotlin Multiplatform.

# Assessing the feasibility of PSKOV 2 without Local Host Access

PSKOV 2 and original PSKOV assume there is Local Host Access running
in order to access PC's local filesystem to read Markdown files and
write HTML ones.

In March I assessed if Isomorphic-Git is able to read and write to Git
repositories from a web browser. The assessment succeeded. Actually,
this was the second assessment of Isomorphic-Git. The first one happened in
2021, however, it ended as a failure because Isomorphic-Git cannot work without CORS
proxy with, say, GitHub due to web browser limitations.

Isomoprhic-Git's dependency on CORS proxy is still there, though.
However this time I've discovered [Vercel][vercel] service with a free plan
that allows anyone to run his own copy of CORS proxy (here's the
[guide][guide]). This solves the problem of accessing GitHub, at least unless
Vercel goes bankrupt.

# April

In April I plan to further the research of Git by creating a tiny notes
application. This will help me understand how to use Git in PSKOV 2.

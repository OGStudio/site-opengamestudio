# PSKOV 2 without LHA

Current PSKOV 2 implementation in Kotlin and the original PSKOV implementation
in JavaScript assume there is Local Host Access running at some port to be
able to work with files: read Markdown files and generate HTML out of them.
LHA is necessary because web browsers neither have access to OS FS, nor
can load arbitrary web site. This is all done for security.

However, meet portability. What is a portable application? It's something
that you write once for one system and that you can run it (port it) to
another one. The last year was dedicated to an actual porting of Python
and later Kotlin to other systems by researching the path of translating
source code from Python/Kotlin to the source code of target system. Like
Swift for Apple. Or C++ for Desktop.

Kotlin proved itself a good choice but not enough to put costs really down
to zero. Zero meaning the application should just work, let's say, 5 years
after you released it. PSKOV in JavaScript does work today even though it
has been written in 2019. It didn't change a bit since then. Only LHA was
created to replace LFSA, the former solution to let client side JS
access local file system.

So, back then in 2021 I was researching Isomorphic-Git to have only web
browser application that does not need a local file system. It went pretty
good back then up to the point where I needed a CORS proxy to bypass
web browser restrictions to have an access to external Git.

I returned back to this issue in March and found out there now exists a
wonderful Vercel service that can host such a CORS proxy for free, for
personal low-bandwidth use, of course.
Therefore I prepared a step-by-step guide how to install Isomorphic-Git's
CORS proxy into Vercel.

And that puts the costs really down to zero (unless Vercel goes bankrupt).
Meaning it's possible to make PSKOV 2 work completely in the browser
with the Git repository of your choice. Without the need to install LHA
locally.

I've spent March to research how git cloning, pushing, pulling works. And
it's working fine.

# April

In April I plan to create a simple notes web application to save them
directly in Git. This application will help me get trained with git
in web browser to later apply the knowledge to PSKOV 2 as a web solution.

# The first Bus pattern implementation

I spent January and February making Bus pattern implementation for iOS.
The end result looks nice to me.

I have also done load testing. Turns out, the Bus is 92 times more expensive
than a function call. Nonetheless, this doesn't mean Bus is bad. On the
contrary, the numbers highlight the Bus should be used in architectural
glue code where it can save up to 30% of code

This example demonstrates several states rendered through a single instance:

# Immediate plans

The plan for the coming months looks like this:

| № | Month | Goals | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | March | 1. Create "Memory" game for iOS<br><br>2. Create "Memory" game for macOS | Isolated projects without shared portable code. Swift, SwiftUI |
| 2 | April | 1. Create "Memory" game for browsers<br><br>2. Create "Memory" game for Android | Isolated projects. TypeScript, JavaScript, Kotlin, Compose |
| 3 | May   | 1. Create "Memory" game for Linux<br><br>2. Create "Memory" game for Windows | Isolated projects. Python? Ruby? C++? Go? Qt? GTK? UWP? |
| 4 | June | Create the first portable chunk of code | Set of items and selection? |

Why "Memory" game? Because it's tiny and there's enough [experience creating it][memory] before.

Until next time.

This article summarizes the work we did to produce the first two cross-platform OpenSceneGraph examples.

By the time [the first technology demonstration of OGS Mahjong 2][tech-demo-1] has been released, we've already had [issue request][android-image-issue] (to explain how to load images with OpenSceneGraph on Android) hanging for some time. We considered creating a new tutorial for [OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide][osgcpg] at first. However, we realized that it's time-consuming and excessive for such a tiny topic (compared to what an average game has) as image loading. We decided to continue sharing our knowledge in the form of concrete examples. That's how [OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples][osgcpe] were born.

Each example:

* explains crucial code necessary to perform a specific task
* accents platform-specific nuances
* provides implementations to cover desktop, mobile, and web platforms
* provides a web build to showcase results

The first two examples cover the following topics:

* Embed resource into executable: this greatly simplifies resource handling across platforms
* Use PNG images with PNG plugins: this explains the requirements necessary to build and use PNG plugins

We will be adding new examples as we proceed with OGS Mahjong 2 development.

That's it for summarizing the work we did to produce the first two cross-platform OpenSceneGraph examples.

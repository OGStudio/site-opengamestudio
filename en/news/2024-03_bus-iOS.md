# The first Bus pattern implementation for iOS

I spent January and February making Bus pattern implementation in Swift for iOS.
The end result looks nice to me.

I have also done load testing. Turns out, the Bus is 92 times more expensive
than a function call. Nonetheless, this doesn't mean the Bus is bad. On the
contrary, the numbers highlight the Bus should be used in architectural
glue code where it can save up to 30% of code

This example demonstrates several states rendered through a single instance:

# March plans

I'm going to spend March to have a draft of the portable code in C++ for OpenWrt 12.09 (Atheros AR9331).

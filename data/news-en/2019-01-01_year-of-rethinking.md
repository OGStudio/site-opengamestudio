It was a year of reimagining and rethinking. As some of you may remember, we started this project to make a game development tool. During the years, the idea evolved from one form to another, sometimes the changes were significant, other times we threw away all the code and started anew.

As a result of all these changes, we came to the end of the year 2018 without a tool, but with a clear understanding of what tool are we making.

There are plenty of fine game development tools out there. Some of them are even open source. We spent plenty of time trying them, and some are quite good.

We can't, and we don't want to compete with them. Our targets are maximal accessibility and simplicity. Our goal is to make a tool suitable for teaching children, but powerful enough to be used for prototyping. To use any powerful development tool, you need a PC or a laptop. We want to make the toolset, that can be used anywhere. We already made some steps in this direction, and we will continue this course.

So, we're beginning a new year without precise plans, but with clear knowledge of our goal instead. Let's wait and see if this approach works better.

Happy New Year to all of you! See you soon!

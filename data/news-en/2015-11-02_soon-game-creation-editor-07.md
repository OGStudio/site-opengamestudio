As we have promised, we are ready to give you Editor 0.7 which is capable of creating the complete test chamber. However, after recreating the test chamber ourselves, it became clear that:

1. it takes more than 8 hours to recreate it (too long)
1. it's inappropriate to be presented in the form of an article (too boring)


Therefore we decided to hold a live session at <a title="LiveCoding" href="https://www.livecoding.tv/kornerr">LiveCoding</a> SOON to show you how to create a simple <a title="Whac-a-mole" href="http://google.com/search?q=whac+a+mole">whac-a-mole like game</a> from scratch.

Currently we are busy making final preparations, so we'll tell you the exact time and date this week. Stay tuned!

As promised, we have come up with a list of milestones and their approximate dates for the coming year:

1. Editor 0.7.0 (October 2015) - Actions' system: we recreate the <a title="Test chamber" href="https://youtu.be/9_6seUWcPbU" target="_blank">test chamber</a>
1. Editor 0.8.0 (December 2015) - Sound system
1. Editor 0.9.0 (February 2016) - Particles' system and minimal UI
1. Editor 0.10.0, Player 0.1.0 (April 2016) - Player to play what Editor produced: we create Shuan prototype with our engine
1. Editor 0.11.0, Player 0.2.0 (June 2016) - Networking: we create Classic 4-player Mahjong prototype


These approximate dates presume one coder spends 40 hours a month. That's about 1 work week at full-time job. Not much, but that's the only time we have.

We will post more details about Editor 0.7.0 shortly: we need to decide what features deserve 80 hours of our time for the next 2 months.

The development of Editor 0.3.0 showed us, that usage of custom GUI was not a perfect idea. A few months ago, custom GUI seemed as a simpler way to do things, but it turned out to lack many little features, that are crucial if you're planning to make a convenient tool.

In the end, we decided to do what we wanted to do in the first place - to use Qt library as the GUI library for our editor.

So, we'll rewrite the Editor with Qt interface and a little bit refreshed project concept in mind. We plan to release the editor with new GUI and a set of basic features like loading and saving projects in May.

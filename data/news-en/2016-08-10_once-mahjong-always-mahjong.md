We started Opensource Game Studio project a long time ago. We wanted to provide open source community with tools to create games. However, it was unclear what tools' purpose was. So we decided to start small: create a game first.

It took us 3 years to reach the first goal: we released OGS Mahjong 1.0 in 2012. Even for a hobby project (we spend about 40 hours a month) it's too long.

Upon the game release we got it: **Tools are means to save development time**.

We spent 4 more years to develop them. Now is the time to prove they are worth every single day spent. How? We will **recreate Mahjong solitaire mode** in just a few hours!

Join our next live session in September.

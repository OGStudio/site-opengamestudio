Since we held 2 live sessions to create "Rolling ball" game, here are 2 YouTube videos of the process:

"Rolling ball" game for Linux (Debian based), OS X (10.9+), Windows <a title="SourceForge" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osrpgcreation/files/Games/RollingBall/">is available at SourceForge</a>.

Simply unpack it and launch the run script.

Editor 0.8 <a title="SourceForge" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osrpgcreation/files/Editor/jenkins/46_2016-01-30_22-20-41_0.8.0/">is available at SourceForge</a>, too.

"Rolling ball" project for the Editor <a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/OGStudio/rollingBall.ogs/archive/master.zip">is available at GitHub</a>.

To open it in the Editor:

* replace slideDown.ogs with rollingBall.ogs you downloaded
* rename rollingBall.ogs to slideDown.ogs

Since live session took us so long, we decided to concentrate on polishing. Editor already has a lot of features, but their use is inconvenient. We will fix major obstacles for the next Editor release.

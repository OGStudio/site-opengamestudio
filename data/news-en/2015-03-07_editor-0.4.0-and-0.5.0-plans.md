We completed Editor 0.4.0 in January. As it was planned, it only contains basic abilities to open and save a project. The major goal was to make MJIN, Python and Qt work together (we were unable to use PyQt or PySide due to technical difficulties).

You can <a title="Editor 0.4.0" href="http://youtu.be/3cqiTIjWwA8" target="_blank">see 0.4.0 in action here</a>. 

We started Editor 0.5.0 development in February. It's 45% ready at the moment.

Editor 0.5.0 planned features:

1. Scene node tree editing
1. Property browser with nodes' position and model editing
1. Qt5 support for the sake of easy building on various Linux distributions

We estimate to complete it in April.
